A simple CRUD app made with React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer and custom implemented) built as a training exercise using local storage to save user data.

Initial styling bootstrapped with MaterialUI (this will change later).

Bootstrapped with Create React App.

All the usual C.R.A. scripts:

### `npm start`
### `npm test`
### `npm run build`
### `npm run eject`
